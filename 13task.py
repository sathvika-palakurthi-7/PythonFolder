# 3.FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints numbers
# from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print
# Fizz. For multiples of five, print "Buzz". For
# numbers which are multiples of both,Â print
# FizzBuzz.
# for i in range(1,101):
#     if i%3==0 and i%5==0:
#         print("fizzBuzz")
#     elif i % 3 == 0:
#         print("Fizz")
#     elif i % 5 == 0:
#         print("Buzz")
#     else:
#         print(i)

# 2.List Iteration: Create a list of numbers. Write a for
# loop to print each number and its square

# l1=[2,3,4,6]
# for i in (l1):
#     print(i**2)

#  Number Guessing Game: Write a script
# that generates a random number and allows a
# user to guess it, providing "higher" or "lower"
# feedback until they guess correctly.
# import random
# random_no = random.randint(1,10)
# guesses = 0
# while True:
#     user_input = int(input())
#     guesses += 1
#     if user_input < random_no:
#         print("Higher! Try again.")
#     elif user_input > random_no:
#         print("Lower! Try again.")
#     else:
#         print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number {random_no} in {guesses} random_noattempts.")
#         break
